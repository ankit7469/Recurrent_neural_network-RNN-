#  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — Sequence Prediction (TensorFlow/Keras)

This project demonstrates a simple **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** built using **TensorFlow & Keras**  
to learn patterns from **sequential data**.  
RNNs are used for tasks where **order and time** matter — such as text, speech, and time-series prediction.

##  Project Highlights

- Created a simple RNN model using Keras  
- Worked with sequential numerical data  
- Trained RNN to learn patterns (next value prediction)  
- Visualized results and tested on new sequences  
- Beginner-friendly implementation of deep learning for sequences

##  What I Learned

### ✔ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- RNNs remember **previous steps** using hidden states  
- Best for sequential datasets (text, speech, time-series)  
- Output at each time step depends on **previous data**  

### ✔ Timesteps & Features
Data is reshaped as:
